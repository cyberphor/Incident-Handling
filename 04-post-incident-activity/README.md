## Change Control
Change Control document/address the changes you made during the Containment phase.

## Lessons Learned
Discuss what in the Incident Response Plan should change. The Incident Response Team Leader is responsible for implementing the suggestion developed using the Change Control process. Turn Behavior-based Analysis into Signature-based Analysis (to automate detection). For example, use Windows Event IDs relevant to the incident to develop a signature and improve your prevention, detection, and response capabilities. 

## Reporting
Reporting will enable the organization to recount what happened, implement new controls, and conduct training; include what is listed below in your report. 
* Chronology of events during the incident lifecycle
* Root cause for the incident
* Location of where evidence was collected from
* Actions taken during the response
* Impact estimate
* Validation results captured during the Eradication phase
* Documentation of the Lessons Learned review

## Evidence Retention
Make a formal decision on how and when to get rid of evidence.
