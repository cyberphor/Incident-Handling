**Chapter 7**  
**Recovery Procedures**

**7-1. Overview**   
The Recovery sub-phase of incident handling is when we return impacted computers to a fully mission capable status. This will involve restoration, validation, and monitoring procedures. 

**7-2. Restoration Procedures**  
Cyber Defense personnel will coordinate an appropriate time to return recovered computers to the network. Coordination must involve the ISSO, key stakeholders, and the appropriate system and/or network administrators. 

**7-3. Validation Procedures**  
Cyber Defense personnel will ensure key stakeholders and the appropriate system and/or network administrators conduct user acceptance testing immediately after returning recovered computers to the network. Said testing will confirm the right hardware, software, and data is available and accessible to only authorized personnel. 

**7-4. Monitoring Procedures**  
Cyber Defense personnel will ensure they prioritized recovered computers first during their daily security monitoring checks. When possible, Cyber Defense personnel should develop and implement IDS rules and SIEM alarms to detect attempts to re-violate computer security policies.
