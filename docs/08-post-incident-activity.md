**Chapter 8**  
**Post-Incident Activity Procedures**

**8-1. Overview**  
The Post-Incident Activity phase is when we generate a report, conduct an After Action Review (AAR), and implement Lessons Learned. 

**8-2. Procedures for Conducting an AAR**  
Cyber Defense personnel will conduct an AAR after all recovered computers have been returned to the network. They will conduct the AAR in accordance with Army Regulation 11-33, “Army Lessons Learned Program.” The primary goal of this type of AAR is to reach an agreement on the Executive Summary section of the imminent report. 

**8-3. Reporting Procedures**  
After an AAR has been conducted, Cyber Defense personnel will generate a report for continuity purposes. The report must be in memorandum format and include an Executive Summary, Recommendations, and Timeline section. 

**8-4. Procedures for Implementing Lessons Learned**  
The ISSO will coordinate with the appropriate system and/or network administrators to implement recommendations approved by relevant stakeholders. Cyber Defense personnel will ensure lessons learned during the incident are used to improve our organization’s incident handling capability.
