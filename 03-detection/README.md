# Chapter 3 
## Detection Procedures  

### 3-1. Overview  
The Detection sub-phase of incident handling is when we survey the network for suspicious and/or malicious activity worth escalating into the Analysis sub-phase. The network is organized into four Detection Zones. Cyber Defense personnel will use the Daily Security Monitoring Checklist discussed below to collect and check events from each Detection Zone.

### 3-2. Detection Zones  
The network is organized into four different Detection Zones in order to reflect the context of what can be observed within that area of cyberspace.
Network Perimeter. Events at the network entrance/exit (data sources: network-based firewalls, routers, Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), etc).
Host Perimeter. Events unique to every network interface (data sources: switches, host-based firewalls, Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS), etc).
Application Level. Events unique to every program (data sources: mission command applications, web servers, name resolution servers, file sharing servers, etc.)
System Level. Events unique to every computer (data sources: anti-malware programs, file integrity checkers, host-based security systems, the Operating System, the kernel, etc).

### 3-3. Daily Security Monitoring Checklist  
Cyber Defense personnel will execute the checklist in appendix I at the beginning of every duty day. All observations made while executing the checklist must be recorded using DA Form 1594 and the SOPs listed below.
* Page Number. Put the page number.
* Number of Pages. Put the total number of pages.
* Organization or Installation. Put our section followed by our unit identifier.
* Location. Put our building number.
* Period Covered - From. Put the time checks began (use the DD MMM YY date format).
* Period Covered - To. Put the time close-of-business occurred (use the same format).
* Item Number. Put the Item Number of the check. Use the same Item Number for the check you are referencing even if you add entries for other checks. Entries about a check do not need to be consecutive.
* Time in. Put the time the current observation was added to the journal.
* Time out. Leave this field blank.
* Incidents, Messages, Orders, etc. Record all details relating to the check being executed in this column. A single entry does not need to fit on one line. If a check produces nothing significant, put “NSTR” (or “Nothing significant to report”).
* Action Taken. Put one of the following: logged (L), escalated (E), or false positive (F).
* Initials. Put your initials in this field.
