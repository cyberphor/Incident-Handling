### How to Build a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Overlay Using MITRE ATT&CK Navigator

---

**Task.** Build a CTI overlay using MITRE ATT&CK Navigator.

**Purpose.** The ATT&CK Navigator is designed to provide basic navigation and annotation of MITRE ATT&CK matrices. A “layer” is a custom view of the ATT&CK knowledge base. By compounding layers (i.e., “building an overlay”), you can highlight common techniques used by cyber adversaries, enabling you to develop your detection requirements. 

**Conditions.** You have access to MITRE ATT&CK Navigator.

**Standard.** You were able to build a CTI overlay using MITRE ATT&CK Navigator.
