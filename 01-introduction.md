**Introduction**  

**1-1. Purpose**
This document assigns responsibilities and establishes Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Incident Handling. It supports the unit’s Operating Forces Security Plan (OFSP) and Incident Response Plan (IRP) by implementing a number of best practices from the sources listed in appendix A.

See appendix A.

**1-3. Explanation of Abbreviations and Terms**
In addition to the explanations provided below, see the glossary for all abbreviations and terms.
* Computer. A machine with the ability to calculate, transmit, and/or receive data.
* Network. A medium of two or more interconnected computers.
* Security. The state of being free from care or trouble. This term originates from the latin expression, “se cura” (a combination of the words “free from” and “care”). Security is achieved through protection and maintained by defense.
* Protection. Preventing harm by shielding the target from the source.
* Defense. Reacting to harm by defeating and removing the source.
* Policy. A collection of principles adopted by an organization in order to prevent the exhaustion or abuse of a resource.
* Event. An observable occurrence within a computer or network.
* Incident. A computer security policy violation. Incidents can be anticipated via precursors and detected through the discovery of indicators.
* Precursor. Evidence suggesting an incident may occur in the future. Examples are log entries showing usage of a vulnerability scanner, new exploits being published, and/or threats being made against the organization.
* Indicator. Evidence suggesting an incident has or is occurring now. Examples are Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) alerts, anti-malware alerts, and/or multiple failed logins from an unknown computer.
* Computer Network Defense. Actions taken to defend against unauthorized activity within computer networks. After the issuance of Joint Publication 3-13, “Information Operations,” this term was formally deleted from the Department of Defense (DoD) dictionary and replaced by the use of “cyberspace defense.”

**1-4. Overview**
Incident handling is detecting, analyzing, and responding to incidents in order to mitigate their operational and technical impact. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) organizes incident handling into four phases: (1) Preparation, (2) Detection & Analysis, (3) Containment, Eradication, and Recovery, and (4) Post-Incident Activity. The following chapters summarize the actions that must be taken during each of these phases and/or sub-phases.
